Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences](https://pwl.uni-koeln.de/en/team/professors/dr-elisa-gerten) at the University of Cologne.

I work at the intersection of personnel and organizational economics, with a focus on applied microeconometrics and causal mechanisms. I am interested in how advanced technology affects organizations and management practices. My current work is based on German firm-level and worker-level data of the [Institute for Employment Research](https://www.iab.de/).

For my work, I received the [Heinz König Young Scholar Award 2022](https://www.zew.de/en/press/latest-press-releases/zew-honours-young-researcher-from-the-university-of-basel) from ZEW Mannheim and SAP SE and the [Emilie Louise Frey Award 2019](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/faculty/awards-and-distinctions/emilie-louise-frey-preis/) from the University of Basel.

My latest working paper:

- ICT, Hierarchy, and Job Design (with M. Beckmann and M. Kräkel) [IZA Discussion Paper No. 15491 08/2022](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/15491/information-and-communication-technology-hierarchy-and-job-design)
