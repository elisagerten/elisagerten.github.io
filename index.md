Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences](https://pwl.uni-koeln.de/en/team/professors/dr-elisa-gerten) and the [Center for Social and Economic Behavior](https://c-seb.de/en/) (C-SEB) at the University of Cologne, and associated member of the [ECONtribute Cluster of Excellence](https://econtribute.de/de/people/dr-elisa-gerten/).

I work at the intersection of personnel and organizational economics, with a focus on applied microeconometrics and causal mechanisms. I am interested in how advanced technology affects organizations and management practices. My current work is based on German firm-level and worker-level data of the [Institute for Employment Research](https://www.iab.de/).

For my work, I received the [Heinz König Young Scholar Award 2022](https://www.zew.de/en/press/latest-press-releases/zew-honours-young-researcher-from-the-university-of-basel) from ZEW Mannheim and SAP SE and the [Emilie Louise Frey Award 2019](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/faculty/awards-and-distinctions/emilie-louise-frey-preis/) from the University of Basel.
