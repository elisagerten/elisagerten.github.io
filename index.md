Welcome to my website, 

Currently, I am seeking new professional challenges. 

I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) and obtained my PhD from the University of Basel. I worked at the intersection of personnel and organizational economics, with a focus on new work, the development of new management practices and new technologies. My work was based on German firm-level and worker-level data of the [Institute for Employment Research](https://www.iab.de/).

For my work, I received the [Heinz König Young Scholar Award 2022](https://www.zew.de/en/press/latest-press-releases/zew-honours-young-researcher-from-the-university-of-basel) from ZEW Mannheim and SAP SE and the [Emilie Louise Frey Award 2019](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/faculty/awards-and-distinctions/emilie-louise-frey-preis/) from the University of Basel.
