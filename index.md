Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Faculty of Management, Economics, and Social Sciences](https://wiso.uni-koeln.de/en/) at the University of Cologne.

I work at the intersection of personnel and organizational economics, with a focus on applied microeconometrics and causal mechanisms. I am interested in how advanced technology affects organizations and management practices. My current work is based on German firm-level and worker-level data of the [Institute for Employment Research](https://www.iab.de/en/iab-aktuell.aspx).
