### AI technology, environmental sustainability, and employee-centric management

This study discusses three pressing challenges that firms have to cope with, namely artificial intelligence, climate change, and the changing nature of workplaces, and their effects on firm performance. I argue that if firms deploy AI technologies and comply with regulated environmental standards, it is crucial to actively adapt management practices that increase the empowerment of employees, employee inclusiveness, and equality. I call such management practices 'employee-centric' and emphasize the complementary role between AI technologies, environmental sustainability, and employee-centric management. I test for three-way complementarities among these organizational practices by applying the cube-view of complementarities on German firm-level data. I find disproportionate productivity and profitability effects in German firms implementing the whole three-way system of complements rather than introducing these practices in isolation or as incomplete two-way combinations.

### Technology and performance pay in organizations

In this study, I draw on established theories in labor and organizational economics to emphasize theoretically that ICT increases task complexity and worker interdependencies. This shift towards non-routine team tasks - I call it 'Team-Biased Technological Change' (TBTC) - boosts the need to adapt incentive schemes towards collective performance pay. To date, there has been little literature addressing changes in the compensation system that stem from the proliferation of modern technologies in the workplace. This study aims to close this research gap. Using unique German panel data on management practices from the years 2014 to 2018, I apply the bracketing-property approach to show that the deployment of ICT at the worker-level leads to adaptations in the compensation system, especially in lower layers in an organizational hierarchy.

### ICT, hierarchy, and job design 
[ECONtribute Discussion Paper No. 189/2022](https://www.econtribute.de/RePEc/ajk/ajkdps/ECONtribute_189_2022.pdf) *joint work with Michael Beckmann and Matthias Kr√§kel*

In recent decades, information and communication technology (ICT) has changed the design of jobs on a large scale. However, it remains unclear, whether these changes will lead to more centralization or more decentralization within firms. The previous literature on this debate has focused on a strict dichotomy between both possible directions. On the contrary, the theoretical and empirical analyses in this study show that equipping employees with ICT yields both more centralized \textit{and} more decentralized job-design policies. This finding is particularly pronounced for executive employees, who are granted more work autonomy but also face more control via stronger monitoring. While the theoretical framework is based on a modified principal-agent model, the empirical approach relies on parametric and semiparametric estimation models, thereby exploiting the geographical variation of instrumental variables.
